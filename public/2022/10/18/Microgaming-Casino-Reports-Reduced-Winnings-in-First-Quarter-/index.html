      		<h1 id="Microgaming-Casino-Reports-Reduced-Winnings-in-First-Quarter"><a href="#Microgaming-Casino-Reports-Reduced-Winnings-in-First-Quarter" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming Casino Reports Reduced Winnings in First Quarter"></a>Microgaming Casino Reports Reduced Winnings in First Quarter</h1><p>Microgaming casino, one of the world’s largest online casinos, released its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 this week. While not all aspects of the company were negative - total poker revenues were up by 2.5% compared to the same period last year - the news wasn’t good for online slots and other games.</p>
<p>According to the report, Microgaming’s net gaming winnings (the amount of money won by players minus the amount they lost) was down 3% from Q1 2017. In monetary terms, this means that the company took in $163 million during the first three months of this year, as opposed to $169 million in the first quarter of 2017.</p>
<p>The company has tried to put a positive spin on these numbers, attributing at least some of the decline to increased competition in the online gambling market. Microgaming claims that is has “responded effectively” to rising global demand for mobile gambling, with more than half its total gaming revenue now coming from mobile devices.</p>
<p>However, it’s hard not to see these numbers as a sign that Microgaming is starting to feel the pinch of increased regulation and competition in the industry. The fact that it is reporting reduced winnings despite an increase in poker revenues speaks volumes about how competitive the online gambling market has become.</p>
<h1 id="FortuneFactory-Slots-see-Decline-in-Winnings"><a href="#FortuneFactory-Slots-see-Decline-in-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="FortuneFactory Slots see Decline in Winnings"></a>FortuneFactory Slots see Decline in Winnings</h1><p>Slot machines, popularly known as one-armed bandits, have been declining in profitability for the past couple of years. The main factor for this shift has been attributed to the legalization of gambling in other states which has since saturated the market. </p>
<p>The $9.6 billion generated from slot machines in casinos last year was down from a record $11.8 billion in 2006, despite the fact that gaming machines have been popping up in ever-growing numbers at racetracks and elsewhere, according to data compiled by UNLV’s Center for Gaming Research.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that gamblers aren’t just playing slots at casinos anymore; they’re also spending their money on poker and blackjack tables, trying their luck at video keno or buying scratch tickets. Slot machine revenue still makes up the bulk of casino income, but other games are catching up. “You used to see people coming in and putting all their money into slots,” said UC Riverside economist John Cogan. “Now they spread it around a bit more.” </p>
<p>In Atlantic City, where casino gambling was legalized first, slot revenue peaked at $5.2 billion in 2006 but had declined to $3.4 billion last year. Slots accounted for more than two-thirds of casino revenue in Atlantic City as recently as 2005; last year that figure was down to about half. </p>
<p>One bright spot for the industry has been Internet gambling, which is growing rapidly; but even there, slot machines account for most of the action. In Nevada last year, slots generated $1.3 billion in revenue online, compared with just $100 million from all other games combined.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-Machines-Down-Across-Microgaming-Casinos"><a href="#Slot-Machines-Down-Across-Microgaming-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="Slot Machines Down Across Microgaming Casinos"></a>Slot Machines Down Across Microgaming Casinos</h1><p>Slot machines are down in operation at numerous Microgaming casinos, according to sources on the ground. Slot machines at the Roxy Palace and Jackpot City, two of the largest Microgaming casinos, have been malfunctioning for approximately two hours. Sources report that players are unable to win any money on the slot machines.</p>
<p>The malfunctions started around 7:00 p.m. GMT and continued throughout the night. Some players managed to get a few free spins before the machines stopped paying out, but no one has reported any winnings since 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Microgaming is investigating the issue and has not released a statement as of yet. The company’s support team is reportedly working to resolve the problem as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Microgaming’s slot machines have failed; in fact, there have been several similar incidents in the past year alone. In March 2017, slot machines stopped working at several UK casinos, including Betfred and Genting Casino. In February of that same year, slot machines stopped working at Euro Grand Casino for several hours.</p>
<p>Players are understandably frustrated by this latest incident. Some are calling for compensation from Microgaming, while others are simply calling for better customer service in light of this latest debacle.</p>
<h1 id="First-Quarter-Report-Shows-Reduced-Winnings-for-FortuneFactory-Casino-Brands"><a href="#First-Quarter-Report-Shows-Reduced-Winnings-for-FortuneFactory-Casino-Brands" class="headerlink" title="First Quarter Report Shows Reduced Winnings for FortuneFactory Casino Brands"></a>First Quarter Report Shows Reduced Winnings for FortuneFactory Casino Brands</h1><p>Casino brands under the FortuneFactory umbrella have seen a sharp decline in winnings during the first quarter of the year, according to reports released earlier this week.</p>
<p>The three brands under the FortuneFactory banner – Lucky8, PlayMillion, and Winneroo – all saw significant decreases in overall winnings, with PlayMillion and Winneroo both seeing a decrease of over 20%. Lucky8 fared somewhat better, with a decrease of just over 10%.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that FortuneFactory has had to report reduced earnings; all three brands saw a decrease in winnings for the last quarter of 2017 as well. It is unclear what is causing these downturns, although some analysts are citing increased competition in the casino market as a possible explanation.</p>
<p>In response to these reports, FortuneFactory CEO Alan Green issued a statement saying that his company is “continuing to invest in our products and services in order to provide our players with the best possible experience.” He also promised that “FortuneFactory will be back at the top of its game soon.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Mr. Green can make good on his promise remains to be seen, but it is clear that FortuneFactory faces an uphill battle if it wants to regain its lost ground.</p>
<h1 id="Microgaming-Casino-Reports-Reduced-Winnings-in-Early-2017"><a href="#Microgaming-Casino-Reports-Reduced-Winnings-in-Early-2017" class="headerlink" title="Microgaming Casino Reports Reduced Winnings in Early 2017"></a>Microgaming Casino Reports Reduced Winnings in Early 2017</h1><p>In the last few months of 2016, Microgaming casinos reported significantly higher earnings than they have this year. February and March 2017 specifically have shown a decrease in winnings, with April only just surpassing the earnings seen in March. So far, this trend seems to be continuing into May.</p>
<p>What could be causing this apparent downturn? The most likely explanation is that Microgaming casinos are simply experiencing a natural fluctuation in their winnings, and that things will return to normal soon enough. However, there is also the possibility that some other external factor is at play – for example, a recent change in the gambling regulations or an increase in competition from other casinos operators.</p>
<p>Microgaming is still one of the top casino software providers in the world, so it’s unlikely that any players will desert its platforms en masse. However, if these lower earnings persist for much longer, then there may be cause for concern.</p>
