#  Cedevita Olimpija Picks Up Second Straight Win with Methodical Play

The Cedevita Olimpija picked up their second straight win in convincing fashion with a methodical 89-71 victory over the MZT Skopje. The home side came into the game as heavy underdogs but they were able to frustrate the Macedonian side with their defense and get good looks on the offensive end.

The opening minutes of the game were closely contested, with neither side able to get much separation. However, the home side was eventually able to break through with an 8-0 run that gave them a 17-10 lead midway through the first quarter. The visitors would claw their way back into the game, but Cedevita would take a 30-25 lead into halftime.

MZT Skopje continued to struggle in the third quarter, as Cedevita was able to extend their lead to as many as 18 points. The fourth quarter saw a bit of a rally from MZT Skopje, but it was not enough as they fell 89-71.

Devin Ebanks led all scorers with 24 points on 10-of-14 shooting, while Edwin Jackson added 16 points and eight assists. For MZT Skopje, Marko Simonovski led the way with 21 points on 9-of-14 shooting.

#  Cedevita Olimpija Continues to Impress With Consistent Play

Cedevita Olimpija, one of the top teams in the Euroleague Basketball, has been playing some impressive basketball as of late. With a record of 9-5, they sit in fifth place in the standings and continue to look like a team that could make a deep playoff run.

Led by head coach Igor Kokoskov, Cedevita has been getting great production from all over the roster. Veterans Damjan Rudez and Zoran Dragic have both been playing well, averaging over 13 points per game each. Youngsters Dario Saric and Mario Hezonja have also been contributing, with Saric averaging over 9 points and 5 rebounds per game, and Hezonja averaging over 10 points per game.

The biggest surprise for Cedevita has been center Ante Zizic. The 20-year-old Croatian is averaging over 14 points and 9 rebounds per game, shooting an impressive 63% from the field. Zizic has shown great potential this season and will be a key player for Cedevita as they make their playoff push.

Their success hasn't come easy though, as they've had to battle through some tough competition. In their last two games alone, they've faced off against CSKA Moscow (the current #1 team in Europe) and Laboral Kutxa Vitoria (a team currently in fourth place in the Euroleague). Both games ended in close losses for Cedevita, but it was clear that they can compete with the best teams in Europe.

If Igor Kokoskov can keep his team playing at a high level, there's no reason why Cedevita can't make a run deep into the playoffs. They have all the pieces necessary to be successful, and with some luck they could bring home the coveted Euroleague championship.

#  Cedevita Olimpija Picks up Another Victory, This Time in a Methodical Manner

The Cedevita Olimpija basketball team continued their winning ways with a 66-55 victory over the visiting Partizan NIS Belgrade squad on Sunday evening. The game was largely controlled by the home squad, who led by as many as 14 points in the contest.

The visitors were never really able to get into a groove offensively, shooting only 36 percent from the field for the game. Conversely, Cedevita was very efficient, connecting on almost 55 percent of their shots. Partizan also struggled from long range, hitting only four of their 23 three-point attempts on the night.

For Cedevita, this was another solid performance from top scorer Krunoslav Simon (19 points). Center Ante Zizic had another double-double with 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Marko Bilokapic came off the bench to score 10 points.

Partizan was led by Nikola Milutinov’s 12 points and eight rebounds. Luka Mitrovic added 10 points for the visitors.

#  Cedevita Olimpija Moves to 3-0 With a Methodical Victory Over Krka

The Croatian powerhouse Cedevita Olimpija continued their winning ways to start the season, beating Krka convincingly 96-68. The game was never in question, as Olimpija led from start to finish and piled up the points on the scoreboard. They were paced once again by Samardo Samuels, who had another dominant performance with 22 points on 10-of-15 shooting, five rebounds, and three assists.

Olimpija’s victory over Krka was a showcase of their well-roundedness as a team. Besides Samuels’ big game, six other players scored in double figures, including Dejan Musli (15 points, nine rebounds), Andrija Stipanovic (14 points), and Domagoj Duvnjak (13 points). Krka simply had no answer for Olimpija’s onslaught offensively, shooting only 36% from the field compared to Olimpija’s 53%.

This win puts Cedevita Olimpija at 3-0 for the season and in first place in the Adriatic League. They will next face Slovenian squad Union Olimpija on Wednesday in what should be an exciting matchup. Union Olimpija is currently 2-1 and coming off a close loss to reigning Euroleague champion CSKA Moscow.
