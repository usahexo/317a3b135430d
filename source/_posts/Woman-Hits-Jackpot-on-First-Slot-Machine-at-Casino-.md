#  Historical Slot Machine Re-Opens at Local Casino 

In a world of modern video slots and flashy electronic games, it's nice to see some classic gaming action make a resurgence. Such is the case at the local casino, where a historical slot machine from the early 1900s has been put back into use. 

The old-fashioned machine features three spinning reels with just 10 stops on each reel. While that may not seem like much by today's standards, at the time it was an exciting new development in gambling technology. Players could now watch the individual symbols spin around on the screen, providing a much more immersive experience than just pulling a lever. 

According to some of the casino staff, this particular slot machine is one of only a handful in existence still in working condition. The others are either in museums or privately owned by collectors. So if you're feeling lucky, head down to your local casino and try your hand at this rare piece of gaming history!

#  Nevada's First Slot Machine Turns 100 Years Old 

The original slot machine, known as the Liberty Bell, was created by Charles Fey in San Francisco and installed in the now-defunct Bank Club casino in downtown Reno on October 22, 1913. Celebrations are already underway for the landmark birthday, including a special exhibit at the National Museum of American History in Washington D.C.

When Liberty Bell was first released, it became an instant hit with players. The machine consisted of three spinning reels with five symbols each: hearts, diamonds, spades, horseshoes and a bell. To win, players had to match three symbols on a reel.

While other casinos started installing their own slot machines shortly after Liberty Bell's release, it was Reno's Bank Club that first enjoyed success with the new game. In fact, the casino reportedly raked in $100,000 in profits during the first week alone!

Slot machines quickly spread throughout America and became one of the most popular forms of gambling. Today, there are estimated to be more than 1 million slot machines operating in casinos around the world.

In honor of Liberty Bell's 100th birthday, the National Museum of American History is displaying rarely seen artifacts from Fey's workshop and personal collection. These include early designs for slot machines and even the very first coin purse Fey used to carry his winnings!

To learn more about Nevada's oldest slot machine and how gambling evolved over the last century, be sure to visit the National Museum of American History before October 22nd!

#  First Slot Machine Inventor Honored on 100th Anniversary

The slot machine was invented by Charles Fey in San Francisco in 1894. To honor the centennial of his invention, a plaque was unveiled on February 13, 1994, at the location of Fey’s original factory.

Fey was a German immigrant who arrived in America in 1872 at the age of 21. After working in various manual labor jobs, he became a watchmaker and then opened his own jewelry store. It was in this store that Fey began to experiment with mechanical devices, including slot machines.

The first slot machine had three spinning reels with five symbols each: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs, and horseshoes. Players would insert a nickel into the machine and pull a lever to spin the reels. If they got three of the same symbol, they would win a prize.

Slot machines soon became very popular and were found in bars and saloons throughout California. In 1895, Fey signed a contract with San Francisco’s Mills Novelty Company to produce 1,000 machines per month.

Over the years, slot machines have become increasingly more sophisticated. However, the basic premise remains the same: Insert money, spin reels, hope for winning combination.

Charles Fey is rightly considered the father of the slot machine industry and is honored on its 100th anniversary.
