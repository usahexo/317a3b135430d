#  Talking Stick Resort Casino Sold to Tribe

The Talking Stick Resort Casino, located in Scottsdale, Arizona, has been sold to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. The tribe plans to keep the resort running as it is, with no immediate changes planned.

The Talking Stick Resort Casino has been a popular destination for gamblers in the Phoenix area since it opened in 1998. It features over 2,000 slot machines and table games, as well as a luxury hotel, spa, and golf course.

The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is the second largest tribe in Arizona, with around 30,000 members. The tribe owns and operates two other casinos in the Phoenix area, as well as several businesses and schools.

In a statement released after the purchase was announced, tribal chairman Terry Rambler said that the Talking Stick Resort Casino would continue to operate "just as it has been run for the last 20 years." He added that the tribe was "proud to have this iconic property join our family of businesses and properties."

This is not the first time that a casino has been sold to an Indian tribe. In 2013, Foxwoods Resort Casino was purchased by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe for $2 billion.

#  Tribe to Invest $100 Million in Talking Stick Resort Casino

The Talking Stick Resort Casino announced a major investment from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. The tribe will invest $100 million in the casino, which is expected to create hundreds of jobs.

"We are excited to make this investment in our casino and the many jobs it will create," said Chairman of the SRPMIC, Delpha American Horse. "The Talking Stick Resort Casino is a vital part of our community and we are committed to its success."

The investment is expected to help the casino meet increased demand, as well as create new opportunities for tribal members. In addition to the investment, the tribe has also agreed to enter into a management agreement with the casino's current operator, AGS.

"This partnership is a win-win for both the tribe and AGS," said American Horse. "It will help us meet our goal of expanding and enhancing our gaming operations, while also allowing AGS to continue providing high-quality service to our guests."

The Talking Stick Resort Casino is one of Arizona's largest casinos, with over 2,000 slot machines and nearly 50 table games. It is also home to several dining and entertainment options, including Salt River Cafeteria, Upper Deck Sports Bar & Grill, and TANGO Contemporary Latin Cuisine.

#  Talking Stick Resort Casino to Get a Makeover

The Talking Stick Resort Casino is slated to undergo a major renovation that is expected to cost in the ballpark of $265 million. The renovation will include a new 25-story luxury tower, an expanded and revamped casino floor, and new restaurants and lounges. Work on the project is expected to begin in 2020 and be completed by 2022.

The Talking Stick Resort Casino first opened its doors in 1998, making it one of the oldest casinos in Arizona. The property has come to be known for its Native American-themed decor as well as its high-quality gaming options. However, the resort has seen steadily declining revenues in recent years and is in need of a major update.

The proposed renovation will be spearheaded by the casino's new owner, the investment firm Ichani Gaming & Leisure. Ichani Gaming & Leisure purchased the casino from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community for an undisclosed amount late last year. The tribe had been looking for a buyer for the property for several years.

The new tower will add 400 rooms to the hotel, which currently has 800 rooms. It will also feature a spa, a fitness center, and three pools. The expanded casino floor will cover 150,000 square feet and include more than 1,000 slot machines and 50 table games. And there will be 11 new restaurants and lounges, including two that will be open 24 hours a day.

According to Ichani Gaming & Leisure CEO Hani Ghandour, "We are excited about this project and what it means for both our guests and our team members. This resort has great potential and we are committed to making it one of the premier destinations in Arizona."

Talking Stick Resort Casino isn't the only casino in Arizona that's seeing a major renovation underway. Earlier this year, Sands Corporation announced plans to spend $755 million on renovating its four Arizona casinos: The Sands Expo & Convention Center, Venetian Palazzo Hotel & Casino Las Vegas, Sands Bethlehem in Pennsylvania, and Sands Regency Casino Hotel Reno.
