The first thing you need to do when starting a new game is create your character. There are four classes to choose from – warrior, rogue, wizard, and healer – each with their own unique abilities and strengths. You then need to give your character a name and select their appearance.

Your health points (HP) and energy points (EP) are shown at the top of the screen; when HP or EP reaches zero, your character will die or become exhausted, respectively. To restore HP or EP, pick up energy or health potions that are scattered throughout the world. Note that if an enemy hits you while you have an active potion in your hand, it will be consumed so use them wisely!

Scroll of Adventure features a wide variety of enemies ranging from simple bats and rats to more powerful dragons and golems. Each enemy has its own unique attack pattern which you’ll need to learn in order to defeat them successfully. Some enemies can also steal your gold – be careful not to lose all your hard-earned treasure!

The reward system in Scroll of Adventure is based on experience points (XP). When you defeat an enemy, you will earn XP which can be used to unlock new abilities and stat upgrades for your character.
