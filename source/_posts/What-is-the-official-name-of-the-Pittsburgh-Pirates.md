#  What is the Pirates' history in baseball?

The Pittsburgh Pirates are a professional baseball team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Pirates compete in the National League (NL) as a member club of the league's Eastern Division.

The Pirates were founded on October 15, 1881, as Allegheny Athletic Association. The team plays its home games at PNC Park, located on the north shore of the Allegheny River in the Northside neighborhood of Pittsburgh. The Pirates' current owner is Bob Nutting, and their general manager is Neal Huntington.

The Pirates have won five World Series championships: 1909, 1925, 1960, 1971, and 1979. They also won the 1901 National League pennant, making them one of two teams (the Boston Red Sox are the other) to win pennants in both the American and National Leagues.

Pittsburgh hosted baseball's first-ever Night World Series game on October 1, 1935. By playing at night, the Pirates allowed spectators to attend after their evening jobs ended. The Pirates won that game 2-1 against the Detroit Tigers in front of nearly 25,000 people at Forbes Field; it was also the first major league game broadcast nationally by NBC Radio.
