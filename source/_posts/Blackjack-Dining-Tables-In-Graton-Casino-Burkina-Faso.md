#  Blackjack Dining Tables In Graton Casino Burkina Faso

A dining table in a casino can be used for many purposes. In a blackjack casino in Graton, there are several such tables. There is one main blackjack table, and several small ones that are used for single player games. The small tables are also used for Asian games, including Pai Gow and Fan Tan.

The main blackjack table is rectangular and can accommodate up to six players. It is covered with green felt, and has spaces for players' chips and cards. The table also has metal legs and a protective rail around the edge to prevent cards from being thrown out of the playing area.

There are two decks of cards at each player's position on the table, so that replacement cards can be easily accessible. The dealer also has a deck of cards, as well as a discard holder, shuffle machine, and money tray. The tableau is usually about four feet wide and two feet deep.

When not in use, the table can be folded up to save space. This is done by first rotating the legs inward so that they form a U-shape. Then the tabletop is lowered onto the legs until it clicks into place. The tableau can then be covered with a cloth to protect it from dust and damage.
